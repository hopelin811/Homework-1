    <p>Rafael was born in Italy and adopted by Elena and Emilio Solano, the latter being a cold, critical and distant man. They brought him to America and raised him as their own until Elena left when Rafael was just 4 years old, to be raised by Emilio along with his half-sister, Luisa. Rafael is attempting to find his place in the world and, as he has recently come to understand better that he is longing for the security of a true family. A step on the way has been discovering that Elena and Emilio are not his biological parents – he was born in Italy. His journey now will be one of finding out who he is and what he wants, once he knows.</p>

    <h3>Season 1</h3>
    <p>After talking with his sister, Luisa, to work up the nerve, Rafael is finally ready to accept that he has wanted to end his marriage to Petra for a year. When Petra, unbeknownst to Rafael, uses his last chance of having a baby, he is understandably upset but also confused about the big life choice he had just made to divorce, and what his future will now hold when there is a child involved. Because chances are slim, Rafael finds his desires have shifted to him really wanting to have children, so when Jane Villanueva turns out to be carrying his child he hopes against hope that she will want to keep the baby, which she ends up doing</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Season 2</h3>
    <p> After the birth of Mateo, Rafael panics at learning of his abduction by Sin Rostro and does everything he can to get him back, including working with Michael Cordero. After Sin Rostro arranges a trade for Mateo with Michael, Rafael tells Michael he wants him to be Mateo's godfather – a decision which is later fraught by Rafael and Michael's ongoing competition for Jane's affections. Rafael returns to focusing on his newborn son and winning Jane's heart, while, unbeknownst to him, his ex-wife Petra is complicating matters by self-impregnating with Rafael's hitherto lost second 'sample. </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Season 3</h3>
    <p>After seeing Jane walk down the aisle and marry someone else, Rafael has the chance to feel closure on his romance with her and finally get to move on. After Michael is shot, Rafael cares for Mateo and protects him 24-7, while Jane's in the hospital. After sleeping with Anežka (whom Rafael believes to be Petra) he tells her that he didn't feel anything and they shouldn't start a relationship. Hurt, Anežka plots with Magda to destroy Rafael. Having let go of the romance of his and Jane's relationship, Rafael takes some new stances in his role as Mateo's father, resulting in their co-parenting becoming more balanced. Luisa has gone missing after being kidnapped by Rose and is gone for two months, leaving Rafael worried about his sister. Once she returns, he is relieved but alert to Luisa's emotional condition and whether she's telling the truth about Rose. Luisa brings with her the news that Rose killed Derek Ruvelle and Rafael's mother, Elena Di Nola. Rafael says Elena isn't dead and Michael immediately orders a check on Elena's cell, where she's found dying, likely from poison, saying "my son" and holding a bible.</p>
